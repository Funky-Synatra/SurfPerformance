# Surf+ - iOS App Development Project

This repository contains the source code for Surf+, an iOS application developed using Objective-C and Xcode. This project showcases my experience with iOS development, which complements my work in other areas like AI/ML and web development.

## Description

Surf+ was an early project that I created to explore iOS application development. It incorporates several key aspects of iOS app development, including:

*   **User Interface Design:** Using Storyboards, `.xib` files, and custom UI elements to create an engaging interface.
*   **Objective-C Development:** Implementing application logic using Objective-C, which was the primary language for iOS development at the time.
*   **Data Management:** Integrating frameworks like Core Data and SQLite to manage app data.
*   **System Frameworks:** Using system frameworks such as MapKit, Core Location, Social, Accounts, and others to extend the app’s capabilities.
*   **External Frameworks:** Integrating third-party frameworks such as FacebookSDK.

This project is a part of a series of learning experiences that helped shape my skills as a developer. It demonstrates my ability to:

*   Create full working iOS applications
*   Use a wide variety of frameworks
*   Manage multiple libraries.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```
2.  **Open in Xcode:** Open the `Surf+.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
3.  **Build and Run:** Build and run the project on an iOS simulator or an actual iOS device.

## Important Notes

*   This project is written in Objective-C, which is an older technology. While I am well-versed in this language, I have since progressed into modern languages and technologies such as Python, Swift, and Javascript.
*   This project is being shared as is to reflect my development journey and learning process.
*   The project is configured for a specific iOS version, and some settings or library versions might need adjustment for newer iOS environments.

## Context

This project represents one aspect of my technical background. I have also been working on projects involving:

*   **AI/ML** (Masters degree projects, using Python and TensorFlow)
*   **Web Development** (using Javascript)

I hope this project will help you understand my skills and the breadth of my technical background.
